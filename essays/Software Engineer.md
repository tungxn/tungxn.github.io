## What Even Is a Software Engineer?
What is the difference between a software engineer and a programmer? They sound like they do the same thing: create code, so why the different terminology? A quick google search would show many different answers and results but most websites loosely define them in terms of scope. Software engineers oversee the whole system and the development process while programmers focus on a single task at a time. 

## My Experience In Software Engineer So Far
So far, I am in the beginning stages of learning software engineering. My only experience is creating and maintaining this online professional portfolio. I am interested in designing more websites and seeing how far I can push my skills. I am also interested in learning what other things a software engineer does besides creating websites. Looking at the modules, I am most excited to learn more about UI designs.

## Goals For The Future
My one goal that I want to achieve in software engineering is building a good looking website for one of my parentâ€™s businesses. I hope that I learned everything I need to build a business website in this class. I also would like to work on and add more better projects to my professional portfolio and make a truly strong resume for the future.
