<h2 id="what-is-math-team">What is Math Team?</h2>
<p>I joined my school’s Math Team in my freshman year of high school. Math team is basically a group that competes in math competitions. There would be 7 total competitions in each year and each competition will have 6 solo math events plus a team event. Each meet, the events would be different. The events can be any math topic for example, algebra 2: quadratic equations and functions, geometry: angles in a plane, analytic geometry: lines and circles, and many more. Usually, each student would choose 3 to 4 events to compete in. During the competition, you would have to take a paper test for every event that you choose. The test would last 10 minutes and would always have 3 questions, the first one is worth 2 points, the second one is worth 3 points and the last one is worth 5 points. The final point for our school’s math team is based on the top 3 scores in an events</p>

<h2 id="hard-work-yield-improvements">Hard work yield improvements</h2>
<p>Throughout every year in high school, I would remain in the math team. Despite the math team competition being hard, I enjoyed it. In the beginning it was tough, my total score was barely 3 or 2 points for 3 tests. But over the years, as I practiced more and more, my scores gradually increased and in my senior year of high school, I was able to get 15 points for 3 tests. Granted, it wasn’t the best score by a long shot (some students in my math team can consistently hit 25 points) but it shows that I have made huge improvements compared to when I first started out. Math team taught me that hard work will eventually show.</p>
