## What did I do in the band?
My band journey started in 7th grade when I joined my middle school band. I played the Tuba. It was fun, I remembered playing in public and during fundraisers. It was an enjoyable experience and so I continued band in 8th grade and would be looking forward to joining band in high school. But after 1 year of band in high school, I eventually quit.

## Why did I quit?
There are many reasons why I quit but the most important one is that it stopped being fun. In high school, band eventually turned from a hobby that I enjoyed to a chore that I had to do. Most of this has to do with the way band is taught in my high school. There were some requirements that seemed too much for me. For example, I was required to play in every football game that the school participated in. This in of itself isn’t the issue, the real issue was that the football games would end late at night and every time afterwards, we would have to sit in the band room listening to the band director pointing out every tiny mistake we made including “not sounding enthusiastic enough.” When it was done, we were released around 11:30 pm. As a result of multiple things like that, I lost that initial spark and burning fire for playing in the band. When something turns from a hobby to a chore, it feels like there is a chain holding me down, taking away time that I could have put into other activities. As a result I quit the band after the first year of high school. Some lessons in the past may be to “never give up” but from this experience, I learned that sometimes, to open other doors of opportunity, I had to close some doors that I already opened and that it is perfectly fine to give up.
